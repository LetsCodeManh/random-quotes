  /*
  - SetUp a Database with MongoDB, MySQL or PostgreSQL. I choose PostgreSQL. SinceI have it install and it's compatible with prisma. -Check

  - SetUp Prisma with the Database by using this 
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://NAME:PASSOWORD@localhost:5432/DATABASE?schema=public"
  Using my own of course. After install prisma with npm install prisma and init with npx prisma init. Put the right DATABASE_URL and using npx prisma db pull. I should get the right schema when it's connected. -Check

  - Next step would be using the prisma/client. Set thing up and export prisma. So we can use it everywhere. -Check (The thing is somehow I always get an message that it can't run on the brower. My question would be why not? I am using nextJs??? Shouln't it be server-side-rendering first before it reach the browser? This is where I stuck...)

  - After getting the global prisma. I need do two request. First one would be getting the IP_adresse from the visitors and store it on the database. Second one would be getting the visitors number from the database. After the getting the number I can diplay it in the footer. But unfortunaly I got stuck in the step above...
